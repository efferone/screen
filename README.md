Small script to create a service that will refresh second monitor when the system wakes from sleep.

So originally I made this script due to an issue both a colleague and I were having, me on Debian Trixie, him on MX.
but the issue was fixed so it's now redundant, but keeping it anyway for future ref.

chmod +x both scripts


sudo ./install_screens.sh
